Review

Know the Concepts

• Describe the lifecycle of a file descriptor.


• What are the standard file descriptors and what are they used for?


• What is a buffer?


• What is the difference between the .data section and the .bss section?


• What are the system calls related to reading and writing files?



Use the Concepts

• Modify the toupper program so that it reads from STDIN and writes to
STDOUT instead of using the files on the command-line.


• Change the size of the buffer.


• Rewrite the program so that it uses storage in the .bss section rather than the
stack to store the file descriptors.


• Write a program that will create a file called heynow.txt and write the words
"Hey diddle diddle!" into it.




Going Further

• What difference does the size of the buffer make?


• What error results can be returned by each of these system calls?


• Make the program able to either operate on command-line arguments or use
STDIN or STDOUT based on the number of command-line arguments specified
by ARGC.


• Modify the program so that it checks the results of each system call, and prints
out an error message to STDOUT when it occurs.
