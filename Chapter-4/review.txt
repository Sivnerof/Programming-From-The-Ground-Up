Know the Concepts

• What are primitives?
    Primitives are the lowest level of building blocks provided by a language.
    They provide instructions to the CPU on how to perform certain actions such as mov, add, etc.
    Some examples of primitives in assembly are mov, add, jle, cmp, etc.

• What are calling conventions?
    Calling conventions are standards used by programming languages that describe how a program
    will transfer parameter values, how functions will return data, how variables will be passed in the program, etc.
    These conventions vary from language to language.

• What is the stack?
    The stack refers to a section in memory that is reserved for function calls and local variables.
    As data is pushed onto the top of the stack, the %esp (extended stack pointer) register will hold a pointer
    to the new location, i.e. the top.
    Even though a piece of data is reffered to as "the top of the stack", it actually is located LOWER in memory.
    The more items added to the stack, the closer the "top" gets to the bottom of the allocated memory addresses.

• How do pushl and popl affect the stack? What special-purpose register do
they affect?
    pushl (push long) will move data onto the top of the stack.
    popl (pop long) will remove data from the top of the stack.
    The data that is moved onto or removed from the stack depends on the
    pointer stored in the %esp special-purpose register.
    As data is pushed onto the top of the stack, the %esp pointer is decremented by four bytes,
    pointing to the new top.
    The opposite is true as data is removed from the top of the stack.
    In the case of popl, the %esp pointer will increment by four bytes.

• What are local variables and what are they used for?
    Local variables are processed within a functions lifespan.
    They do not exist outside of the function they were defined in,
    meaning that another function or another part of the program can not use the variable.
    Localizing variables is important for code organization,
    it allows for data to be encapsulated entirely within the functions that need them and nowhere else.
    Other than code organization, local variables also improve memory management by freeing up memory once a function expires. 

• Why are local variables so necessary in recursive functions?
    Everytime a function is called, most of the registers will be wiped.
    In order to preserve data between functions we need to move the values of any
    necessary register onto the stack.
    The %eax is one of the only registers to survive, this is why it used for return values.


• What are %ebp and %esp used for?
    The %ebp (extended base pointer) register is a special purpose register that is used to establish a
    base for referencing local variables, parameters, and other items within a stack frame.
    The base pointer is typically used as a stable reference point.
    The %esp (extended stack pointer) register is a special purpose register that is used to keep track of the top of a stack.
    When using PUSHL to push items onto the stack the %esp register is decremented to point to the new top,
    in this way %esp helps with stack management.

• What is a stack frame?
    A stack frame is a reserved section of memory that contains a functions parameters,
    local variables, return address, etc.



Use the Concepts

• Write a function called square which receives one argument and returns the
square of that argument.
    Refer to square.s program for solution.

• Write a program to test your square function.
    Refer to square.s program for solution.

• Convert the maximum program given in the Section called Finding a Maximum
Value in Chapter 3 so that it is a function which takes a pointer to several values
and returns their maximum. Write a program that calls maximum with 3
different lists, and returns the result of the last one as the program’s exit status
code.

• Explain the problems that would arise without a standard calling convention.



Going Further

• Do you think it’s better for a system to have a large set of primitives or a small
one, assuming that the larger set can be written in terms of the smaller one?

• The factorial function can be written non-recursively. Do so.

• Find an application on the computer you use regularly. Try to locate a specific
feature, and practice breaking that feature out into functions. Define the
function interfaces between that feature and the rest of the program.

• Come up with your own calling convention. Rewrite the programs in this
chapter using it. An example of a different calling convention would be to pass
paramters in registers rather than the stack, to pass them in a different order, to
return values in other registers or memory locations. Whatever you pick, be
consistent and apply it throughout the whole program.

• Can you build a calling convention without using the stack? What limitations
might it have?

• What test cases should we use in our example program to check to see if it is
working properly?
